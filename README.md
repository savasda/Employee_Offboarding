# EmployeeOffboarding

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.2.

##  How to run app
0. Install NPM packages:
```bash
npm install
```

1. Run server with command:

```bash
npm run server:run
```
I wrote a simple NodeJS server that works with an SQLite database.
It will be available at URL http://localhost:5001.

2. Run front-end app with command:

```bash
npm run serve
```
This command will start the Angular application, which will be available on the standard port 4200.
Open the application at URL http://localhost:4200/employees.

This application is intentionally overcomplicated. It is possible to simplify it and remove half of this project,
but the purpose of this test is to check how the candidate operates with Angular.
